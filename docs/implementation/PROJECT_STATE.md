# Project State

Last updated: 2026-08-01 (Asia/Tokyo)
Current stage: P01 — build baseline and modular skeleton
Stage status: VERIFIED (`P01-E001`—`P01-E007`)
P01 starting Git commit: `cb4d66e581c1c5e55c02c64089a5461ac9bae249`

## Recovery protocol after context compression

1. Read this file and the other six ledgers in `docs/implementation/`.
2. Run `python3 scripts/validate_spec_baseline.py` and `python3 scripts/validate_p01_baseline.py` before changing implementation status.
3. Re-read the current phase's cited frozen chapters and query the complete JSON/YAML/CSV inputs that it touches.
4. Never open, parse, hash, screenshot, sample, measure or otherwise inspect the four visual drafts named below.
5. Preserve existing work; inspect `git status --short --branch` before edits.
6. Update evidence first, then promote a row. `VERIFIED` requires a reproducible test/command, environment and result in `TEST_EVIDENCE.md`.

Unified row states:

- `NOT_STARTED`: no compliant production implementation exists.
- `IN_PROGRESS`: implementation has begun but is incomplete or not yet internally complete.
- `IMPLEMENTED`: compliant implementation exists, but required verification evidence is incomplete.
- `VERIFIED`: required repeatable evidence is recorded and passing.
- `BLOCKED`: completion is impossible until the documented external condition changes; code-solvable work is not a blocker.

## Specification baseline

The implementation precedence is:

1. Product requirements, system architecture, domain/accounting/security invariants.
2. Frozen technical stack.
3. UI main contract semantics, interactions and component governance.
4. Token JSON concrete values.
5. Screen YAML coverage.
6. UI traceability matrix acceptance mapping.

`MANIFEST.sha256` is used only for integrity verification. The following visual drafts are excluded implementation inputs: `UI视觉样稿_浅色.png`, `UI视觉样稿_深色.png`, `UI视觉样稿_完整总览.png`, `UI视觉样稿_v1.html`.

## Repository inventory and preserved baseline

| Area | Observed baseline | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| Git | Branch `master`, tracking `origin/master`; no tracked modifications at start | Correct baseline |
| User work | Untracked `docs/Android记账软件_完整开发计划_Codex执行版.md` (SHA-256 `692eab49f7a11224dde6cbdecbe009e496554237eab7ba3d607e5e38094cf97a`) | Preserved; planning input, not a frozen specification |
| Frozen specifications | Four frozen product/technical/architecture/domain Markdown files and the UI contract package are tracked | Correct and integrity-baselined |
| Gradle root | No `settings.gradle*`, `build.gradle*`, `gradlew`, wrapper, version catalog or build logic | Missing; P01 scope |
| Modules | No `:app`, `:benchmark`, `:build-logic`, core, finance, analytics, transfer, feature or widget modules | Missing; P01 scope |
| Production source/resources | No Kotlin/Java, Manifest, Compose, XML, assets, localization, schema or migration files | Missing; P01 and later phases |
| Tests | No JVM, Android, UI, migration, screenshot, accessibility, performance or device tests | Missing; P02 and later phases |
| Scripts/CI | No pre-existing validation scripts or `.github` CI | Missing; P00 adds only the spec baseline validator; CI is P02 scope |
| Generated/build output | No project build products, schema exports, reports, AAB/APK, SBOM or Baseline Profile | Missing as expected |
| Partial implementation | None | None to integrate |
| Conflicting/deprecated implementation | None | None to remove; excluded visual drafts remain tracked review material but are not implementation inputs |

Baseline conclusion: this is a documentation-only repository, not a partial Android application. P00 must not create placeholder production code or claim any feature implementation.

### P01 result

| Area | P01 result | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| Toolchain | Temurin JDK 17.0.20; Gradle Wrapper 9.5.1; AGP 9.3.1; Kotlin 2.4.10; Android compile/target 36 and min 28 | VERIFIED |
| Build governance | AGP built-in Kotlin, Kotlin Compose compiler plugin, KSP 2.3.10, version catalog and seven convention/architecture plugins in the included `:build-logic` build | VERIFIED |
| Module topology | 35 prescribed leaf modules plus five zero-dependency Gradle grouping projects; `:build-logic` is an included build | VERIFIED |
| Dependency direction | Exact allowlisted project graph enforces UI → Application → Domain ← Infrastructure; eight domain/common modules are pure Kotlin/JVM; feature modules have no feature/data/DAO/Room-entity edge | VERIFIED |
| Reproducibility | Wrapper distribution SHA-256 pinned; 37 lockfiles cover root, build logic and all leaf modules; strict dependency verification contains 756 components and 1,253 SHA-256 entries | VERIFIED |
| Production source | Secure application manifest only; no business screen, DAO, persistence, placeholder component or fake functionality was added | Correct for P01 |
| Tests and scripts | P00 and P01 structural validators, Gradle architecture/version checks, Android Lint and all configured JVM test tasks | VERIFIED for P01 scope |
| CI, advanced quality and release | Detekt/format/Kover/SBOM/license/CI/Baseline Profile/release AAB are not introduced early | P02/P36 scope |

P01 preserved all prior tracked and untracked work. The provisional build identity `app.ledger.expensetracker` is not a claim about the final externally supplied Play identity; see `DL-010`.

## Coverage summary

| Baseline item | Count | State |
|---|---:|---|
| Requirements `REQ-001`—`REQ-090` | 90 | `REQ-090` is `IN_PROGRESS`; the other 89 remain `NOT_STARTED` |
| YAML screens/modes/dialogs/system flows `G-001`—`WGT-003` | 215 | All `NOT_STARTED`; baseline rows created only |
| Architecture ADRs | 20 + ADR-007A | ADR-001 `VERIFIED`; the other 20 decisions remain `NOT_STARTED` |
| UI ADRs | 12 | Registered; implementation `NOT_STARTED` |
| Permanent domain invariants | 35 | Registered; verification `NOT_STARTED` |
| Logical schema families | 12 | Registered; implementation `NOT_STARTED` |
| Projection families | 7 + search/geographic indexes | Registered; implementation `NOT_STARTED` |
| Durable/staging/backup operation inventories | 4 groups | Registered; implementation `NOT_STARTED` |

## Stage progression

| Stage | Status | Evidence / entry condition |
|---|---|---|
| P00 | VERIFIED | `python3 scripts/validate_spec_baseline.py` passed; see `P00-E001`—`P00-E006` |
| P01 | VERIFIED | Frozen toolchain, all modules, exact dependency graph, debug/release assembly, locks, verification metadata, lint and tests passed; see `P01-E001`—`P01-E007` |
| P02 | NOT_STARTED | Entry condition satisfied: rerun both validators and `./gradlew p01Check lint test --configuration-cache` before adding quality/CI infrastructure |
| P03—P36 | NOT_STARTED | Do not promote early; follow the dependency graph in the preserved execution plan |

## P02 entry state

P01 has no unresolved blocker. The authoritative recovery commands are:

```text
python3 scripts/validate_spec_baseline.py
python3 scripts/validate_p01_baseline.py
./gradlew p01Check lint test --configuration-cache
```

Expected result: both validators print `PASS`; Gradle reuses the configuration cache and reports `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`. The configured Java runtime must still resolve to JDK 17, and Android SDK Platform 36 plus stable Build Tools 36.x must remain installed.

P02 may add the frozen quality and CI infrastructure on this baseline. It must not weaken strict dependency verification, the exact project-edge allowlist, runtime prerelease scanning or the no-placeholder rule. No business requirement or screen is complete merely because the carrier modules now build.
